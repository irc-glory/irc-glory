# Hello ðŸ‘‹
I go by IRC, and Iâ€™m an intellectual 15 year old from Europe with a passion for technology. I love offensive security and exploring a wide range of tech topics. Some of my interests are penetration testing, robotics, linux, reverse engineering and web development, and right now, Iâ€™m trying to learn more regarding malware.
